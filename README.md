# What do you want to build?

A public meeting aggregator.

I was inspired by this [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13377178).

Let's create a database of public meetings with an API and UI to browser, filter and search it.

# What have you done so far?

- registered `publicmeetings.co` and `ekklesia.co` - [see wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesia_(ancient_Athens) )
- started a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T0g5g8aoaWGhJOjiSGo2SpKeR2JcgI9qI7pPNlTq_sM/edit?usp=sharing) of public meetings in NYC
- setup ZOHO Mail
- created AWS account
